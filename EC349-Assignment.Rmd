## Plans

* First, I have decided to first construct a model out of Ridge regression to help identify which variables might have the strongest explanatory power. If some predictors truly have outsized explanatory power, I will then perform LASSO regression to perform feature selection. 
  * I would examine which model performed better, if some predictors have disproportionate explanatory power, the LASSO should perform better than the ridge.
  
* If there isn't, I would then examine random forests as a possible feasible alternative.
  * This could be seen as a classification problem- depending on conditions, businesses might get above a threshold of stars as stars are given in .5 increments.


### Linear models

* I will first find trends between features to see how stars are given: Would more active users give more or fewer stars on average?
  * To do this, I would have to find the user and business features that could predict stars given. So 2 models first:
    * Stars given according to user features: $$stars = \sum_{j=1}^{u} \beta_j * user feature_j  $$
    * Stars given according to business features: $$stars = \sum_{k=1}^{b} \beta_k * business feature_k  $$
    * Taking the two: $$stars = \sum_{j=1}^{u} \beta_j * user feature_j + \sum_{k=1}^{b} \beta_k * business feature_k$$  
    This will be my starting model for ridge regression.

Remember that big businesses are more likely to have available data and not a whole bunch of NA's. This means I may be better off
creating 2 models, one model for big businesses and one for small.  

I first split training data set on user data into 75/25.
